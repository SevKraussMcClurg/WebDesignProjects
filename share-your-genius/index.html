                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Theater is my passion. Even though I have only been working in theater for the last ~6 years, I have been seeing theater for all my life. 
                I've always loved the production and design elements of theater and recently I have been able to start working in prop production for internships
                and for school productions. I am also working on planning some independent studies for the winter and spring which will be about prop production.
                On this website you will see some of my work and also learn about some of the things I do in theater.
