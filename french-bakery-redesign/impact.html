                <center>Growing up, our parents and family were deeply connected and actively involved with charity

                    in
                    our local community. Naturally, respecting the community and helping those who are in need are
                    ingrained
                    in our daily lives as this is an important value that our family believes in. Today, we follow
                    the
                    same
                    footsteps in supporting the community through French Bakery daily involvement.</center>

                    The French Bakery has been helping nonprofit organizations since it began. Our hard work and
                    donations have been directed toward supportiing shelters, food banks and other nonprofit
                    organizations, both at the grassroots level and larger reach organizations such as Salvation
                    Army
                    and Hope Link. In the past years, we´ve also helped those outside the United States to help
                    fight
                    hunger and provide basic needs for orphaned and homeless children. We‘ve also joined forces by
                    supporting our staff and making donations to the charity organization of their choice.
