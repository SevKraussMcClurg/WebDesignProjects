        <div class="grid-item who-are-we">
            <p>"Although we’ve experienced tremendous change in the past twenty years, some things will remain constant. Our commitment to helping students create their own learning experiences is chief among our objectives. Eastside Prep is a place where you can become the best you there is. We admit interesting people who want to try new things. Our community is kind and supportive, so we look for students who value that type of community. We don’t have a recipe for the “right EPS student;” but we do have an expectation that each student will find a place, feel a connection, and experience the kind of learning that inspires innovative thinking. Our mission says it all— We inspire students to create a better world through Critical Thinking, Responsible Action, Compassionate Leadership, and Wise Innovation.

                This is an authentic learning community. We use tools of all kinds to extend our reach into the world. We also rely on one another to sustain our culture of respect for learning, for self, and for others." (From eastsideprep.org)</p>
