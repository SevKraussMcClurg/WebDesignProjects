            <p>Academics are very important at Eastside Prep, but it is equally important to manage your school work with your extracurriculars and personal life.
                Sometimes it can feel overwhelming to balance your academic goals with outside activities, family responsibilities, and other events, but maintaining that balance will make your high school experience much more enjoyable and less stressful.
                Take some time during your experience at Eastside Prep to find non-academic activities that you enjoy, and to learn and practice different strategies for keeping a good work-life balance.

        <div class="grid-item text2" style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 40px;">
            <p>Free periods are a unique part of the Eastside Prep experience that are incredibly useful in finding your work-life balance.
               There are many different ways you can utilize your free periods; just make sure you have a plan, find an appropriate place on campus (like a quiet spot in TMAC for studying or the LPC for socializing), and choose the method that works best for you:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">   
                <li>Work on school assignments and studying so you can use your after-school hours for extracurricular activities.</li>
                <li>Meet with your teachers for help with class content, assignments, etc.</li>
                <li>Collaborate with your friends - work on group projects, have a group study session, or just sit together for moral support.</li>
                <li>Use your free periods as a social hour with your school friends.</li>
                <li>Take a break from school during the day - go for a walk, take a nap, or get a snack from the LPC.</li>
                <li>If your free period is at the beginning or end of the day, you can arrive to school late or leave early, giving you more time for sleeping or outside activities.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Make sure you're looking ahead to schedule time for school work, extracurriculars, and other events and responsibilities.
                Using an <strong>online or paper calendar</strong> can be very helpful in keeping organized and designating time for each aspect of your life.
