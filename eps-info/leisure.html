                While being productive at school is obviously vital, there comes a time in every student's life
                in which they need to just take a breather and relax. Luckily, EPS provides plenty of choices of
                locations
                and activities which students can busy themselves with. Just remember: ALWAYS make sure that you are not
                sacrificing
                your only available work time, and then you can go off and do anything. The best time is usually during
                a free period
                after completing work. Below are four of the most popular hang-out spots for students at EPS:

        <!--Spot #1 Tali 3rd Floor-->
        <div class="grid-item image spot-1">
            <center><img class="cool-image" width="400px" src="images/eps-learningcenter.jpg"
                    alt="Image of the EPS learning center on the third floor"></center>
            <p>
                The third floor of <b>TALI</b> is a common area to pass the time for good reason.
                It is loaded with relaxing soft chairs, the Friel learning area has board games, 
                and when no classes are happening, the music rooms are free to jam out it with friends.

        <!--Spot #2 Sport court-->
        <div class="grid-item image spot-2">

                    alt="Image of the EPS sport court from above"></center>
            <p>
                The sport court, behind <b>TALI</b> and <b>TMAC</b>, is available for all students to use,
                has multiple basketball hoops and has plenty of space. Next to it is a box full of balls, frisbees,
                and more which are free to use.
