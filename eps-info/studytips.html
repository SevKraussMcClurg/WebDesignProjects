            <p>You can always go to your teachers for help for any reason, inlcuding going over class content, clarifying assignments, or asking for an extension on an assessment if you have a busy week.
                One of the best ways to reach your teachers is to talk to them before or after class, find them in their offices during office hours, or schedule a meeting.
                Eastside Prep primarily uses <strong>email</strong> to contact teachers and <strong>Teams</strong> to schedule meetings.
